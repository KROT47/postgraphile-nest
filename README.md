# PostGraphile for Nestjs

## In Development

## Task List for beta release (1.0.0)

- [x] Add the Graphql Playground
- [ ] Create plugin decorators they can be added to the postgraphile server (helps avoid adding them to `appendPlugins` property)
- [ ] Allow the playground url path to be overridden
- [ ] Allow the postgraphile path to be overridden
- [ ] Look for a better way to postgraphile options instead of the module options
